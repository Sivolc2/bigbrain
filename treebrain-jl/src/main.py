# ### Problem Statement:

# Current AI architectures rely heavily on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which introduces inefficiencies in information retrieval and synthesis. The goal of this project is to develop a novel hierarchical AI approach, where AI agents form a structured tree to process and summarize information progressively. This method eliminates the need for RAG by allowing knowledge to bubble up through layers of specialized agents.

# ### Proposed Solution:

# - **Hierarchical Tree Structure:**
#     - **Leaf AI Agents:** Ingest raw source files and become domain experts on specific topics.
#     - **Intermediate AI Agents:** Summarize and refine knowledge from lower layers.
#     - **Root AI Agent:** Provides the final, high-level synthesis of all collected and processed information. This is another intermediate agent in practice.
